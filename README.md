LaserSoft
====

Laser Engraver Software for the Semester Project of Nicolas Krüsi, Benjamin Krucker and Christof Müller.
A fully operational minimalistic software written in Python and PyQt5.  

# Introduction
In the 6th and last semester of the study programme Mechatronics Trinational,the semester project takes place. During this time a practical project is to be worked on and realized within a group. The choice was made to build a laser engraver, which should be able to engrave an image on different materials. An important aspect of this semesterproject  is  to  develop  a  functional  prototype  or  concept  that  can  be  used  at  university exhibitions for marketing purposes. Despite the coronavirus, which turned the entire tri-national study programme upside down with the lockdowns that followed, our semesterproject was successfully realised. Even some additional features could be implemented.

# Installation
You will need the following packages to run LaserSoft
- Python 3.8
- Pillow	    7.1.2
- PyQt5	        5.14.2
- matplotlib    3.2.1
- numpy	        1.18.4
- opencv-python	4.2.0.34

# Features:
- simple and intuitive interface for small screens
- Configuration completely over the GUI
- Placing and resizing an image optically over the built in camera
- Auto calibration of the axis during start of program
 - Simulation mode for non-Raspberry Pi - Systems (Test's made on Raspbian, Ubuntu and Windows 10)

# Disclaimer
This is a Software used for our University Project. It is by no means a perfect program. Many features like G-Code support, optical calibration with the built in camera and, most important, a port to an Arduino running GRBL are planned.
